ALLISON WANDERER FINAL PROJECT 364

My app lets you enter a web of Twitter followers! You are able to see the most recent followers of a desired Twitter user and then see those follower's most recent followers. On top of seeing the followers, you see their name, handle, description, and location

First, you register and/or log in with your email address
From there, you are welcomed to the home page
On this page you can search for a Twitter user to see their most recent followers and also upload a new profile picture for our site. With the profile picture, you can also check if your profile picture already exists in our internal system or not.

When you go to search for a Twitter handle, you then get a list of that person's 20 most recent followers (name, handle, user description, and where they are from)
Each of the follower's handles are linked which when clicked on takes you to a page of their most recent followers! (same format)

Those follower's handles are also linked which when clicked on takes you to their actual Twitter profile page.
